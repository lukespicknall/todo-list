 A to do list application built with javascript and css and packaged with webpack. Javascript is used to create and manipulate all of the DOM elements. Several functional modules come together to make the app work. Users can create, edit, delete and complete projects and tasks by creating a manipulating objects in an array through UI. Functions to create tasks and projects are stored in js modules that import into the ui.js to be accesed by the user. Data is saved on the users web browser with the localstorage API at each object manipulation point and pulls the data, if any exist, into the code at page load/refresh.
